**Before you start**

Paths in this preamble are relative to this skill's folder.

1. Read the Principles section of the pstack principles index, `../poteto-mode/SKILL.md`. Before applying a principle, read its leaf skill at `../principle-<name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Open a task list whose first items are this playbook's steps, copied verbatim. A step you skip stays on the list with `skip: <reason>`.
3. Do not report done without runtime evidence: output from running the changed thing on the surface the task names. Tests or "it compiles" alone are not done.

Reading the playbook: its relative links resolve from `../poteto-mode/playbooks/`. "The installed plugin", `<plugin>` and "this pstack" mean the folder two levels up from this skill (`../..`), which holds `skills/` and `agents/`. The sections it cites (Non-negotiables, Subagents, Models, Writing the reply) are in the principles index; Opening a PR is `../poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`. A skill it names that is not in your skill list is a file at `../<name>/SKILL.md`: read it instead of invoking it. When you spawn `pstack:poteto-agent`, give it the absolute path of `../poteto-mode/SKILL.md`. On Codex, map Claude tool and model names with `../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md`.

### Refactoring

Resolve the driver skill through [poteto-mode's Non-negotiables](../SKILL.md#non-negotiables).

**You own the contract. The structure changes. The behavior does not.** Distinct from Feature, which adds behavior, and Bug fix, which corrects it.

If the cleanup reveals a missing feature or a real bug, split it out and ship the structural change first against the pinned contract. A redesign is allowed, but name it and route to Feature. Large or cross-cutting structural work belongs to the **figure-it-out** skill. This playbook is the focused-to-medium change.

1. Pin the behavior contract first. Run the **how** skill over the affected subsystem to learn the contract, then write a characterization test, snapshot, or equivalence harness that captures current behavior before any structure moves. If the area has no coverage, write the pin before touching structure. Type check and lint are not a pin.
2. Name the structure the code is missing per **principle-model-the-domain**. Boring code stays when the shape is already clear and local. The reshape must delete branches or invalid states, not add indirection.
3. Name the target shape. State what the module layout, types, and call graph should be if built today (**principle-foundational-thinking**, **principle-redesign-from-first-principles**). If the target crosses a function boundary, run the **architect** skill for parallel design exploration of the shape before the move.
4. Subtract before you add. Delete dead code, collapse one-caller wrappers, drop redundant validators, and remove orphan references before introducing the new shape (**principle-subtract-before-you-add**). The smallest change that reaches the target shape ships (**principle-laziness-protocol**). A speculative cleanup that "might help" gets reverted.
5. Move in small behavior-preserving steps, each keeping the pin green. For API reshapes, migrate every caller and delete the old API in the same wave (**principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis**). No compatibility shims, no parallel old-and-new paths. Spot-check every rename against the actual files. Renames silently miss usages in strings, prose, and back-references. Delegate the mechanical edits to a subagent using your configured refactoring model (default in poteto-mode's Models section) with a specific scope (file paths, the names being moved, the behavior to hold). Pick each subagent's reasoning level for the job, per the Subagents section.
6. Prove behavior is unchanged on the real artifact, not "it compiles" (**principle-prove-it-works**). For larger reshapes, run an equivalence check: a script that diffs old-vs-new outputs, a recorded baseline replayed against the new code, or a smoke run on the matching surface via the relevant driver skill.
7. Confirm the change is worth keeping. The success measure is reduced reader load (**principle-minimize-reader-load**). If the diff does not lower reader load somewhere, revert it.
8. Rebase into small ordered commits. A subtraction commit, then the reshape, then any follow-on cleanup. Shape them with the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, so each behavior-preserving slice stays green before the next. Run **Opening a PR**.

**Reply:** the structure that changed, the pin you held it against, the equivalence proof, the reader-load delta, what shipped and what got reverted. No new behavior.
